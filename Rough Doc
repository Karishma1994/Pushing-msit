A node is a machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of executing a Pipeline.


The workspace directory is where Jenkins builds your project: it contains the source code Jenkins checks out, plus any files generated by the build itself. This workspace is reused for each successive build.

An immutable file generated during a Build or Pipeline run which is archived onto the Jenkins Controller for later retrieval by users. Artifacts can be used to represent data created as a side-effect of running a Jenkins build. Artifacts files are associated with a single build
